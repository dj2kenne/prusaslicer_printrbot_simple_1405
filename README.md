# prusaslicer_printrbot_simple_1405

PrusaSlicer printer settings for the Printrbot Simple Kit, 1405 model (the lazer cut wood one, not the metal one).

Configured and saved from PrusaSlicer version 2.4.2+win64.

Use File > Import > Import Config Bundle.
This will add a Printer and Print settings profile.
The Print / Speed settings seem to work. The rest of the settings should be changed to suit the project.
